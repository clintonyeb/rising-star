Although the whole science of "dreaming" is not yet fully known. We can all agree on some level that dreams occur when our daring minds concur images for us during our sweet sleeps. Most of the time, I think our limitations as human beings are based on the foundation that we have already set. Our minds have being trained to think in a particular way that we can't think anything else. We grow accustomed to our daily problems that we begin to fail to see them anymore. Our body is built to adapt to problems. People who are good at finding the problems and opportunities of life despite the fact that everyone else trying to get comfortable are usually known as innovative and creative.

It's 2018, and I still have to charge my phone. Not only that, most things are built to require a constant supply of electricity. What if instead of working and researching on producing cheaper sources of electricity, we rather work our way towards a battery-less planet. In fact, a fuel-less planet would be better. But is this even possible? If you've studies some form of Physics, you know that matter is nether created nor destroyed but only be converted from one form to another. Our own bodies require food (probably three to four times a day) as fuel to function. Things burn energy, producing heat and other forms of energy like moving parts (kinetic energy) and others. The machines can create these energy they require, other forms of energy needs to be fed to them, and then they will convert this energy into the form the require. I guess that's the way things are. We can never have a fuel-less battery. My phone will always require charging. Dreams dead.

Wait, probably how we can rather improve the way we provide this fuel to machines. Some sources of energy are cheaper than others. So we can work to replace those that are more expensive (usually hard to come by) with ones that are cheaper. So, let's talk about electricity.

Technology and development in Africa is seriously retarded due to lack of a reliable source of electricity. Modern civilization builds on this, digitalization is built on the assumption that there is an unending source of electricity. Many research has been conducted, like solar power systems and many others with the aim of making electricity available to all.

## Little Electrical Stars

Recently, I embarked a little toy project that involved finding a way to extinguish the sun. No, really, what fuels the sun? Since, no one is constantly refilling the sun's source of energy, is it ever going to run out? In fact, forget I said all of that. However, we know for certain that the sun is not burning out very soon, at least not for the next 5 billion years. You see, by that time, my bones will so dry, children will think of me as a myth. I hope they read this. You see because of this, I have paid in 100 years advance time for my blog hosting, hoping that after that 100 years, one lucky grandson of mine will be kind enough to renew it when I die. Perhaps, I should include it in my will. I need this blog to last forever and needs fuel, well money.

What were we talking about again? Yeah, producing electricity for everybody.

So we can have these small electricity producing things in Space, which I call elstars, that can actually conduct and transmit the suns energy into a form that can be used as electricity. An image of an Elstar is shown below, enjoy it whiles it lasts.

## The Physics of an Elstar

Let me help you understand how an elstar works

The function of the base is basically to conduct the sun's heat energy. Because this is the first point of conduct, it will probably be made of one of those metals that rockets are usually made of. The point is, it should be hard enough not to melt and should be able to last a very long time. I would not want to climb there every night to change it, so it better be.

This heat energy is then conducted by the right conducting rod, called producer. Immediately, this heat energy is conducted by the left conducting rod, called consumer. Nothing happens after that.

However, next time that the producer is charged by the sun's energy, because the consumer is also already charged, a tension is built in that space between the consumer and the producer. This tension build and reaction causes an electrical charge to be discharged which is immediately conducted by the Savior. 

It's called Savior because, well, it just saved an electrical charge from going to waste. Thank you. 

This electrical charge is then transferred to transmitter that can transmit an electrical energy from Space to an electrical tower on earth. All we have to do then is provide more towers like what mobile network providers have being doing until the whole planet is electrified.

I won't be surprised at all if aliens on another planet are already implementing this idea. Most of my brilliant ideas are usually implemented by others except this one, so I can be sure of this.
