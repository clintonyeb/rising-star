# The Complexity of the Brain.

What's the color of that **blue** shirt? Errm blue. Well, that was easy. Let's try that again. How would you explain the color 'blue' to a child?

We have still not been able to understand the full workings of the brain. The brain is such a complex organ that it cannot comprehend itself. The whole of our body depends on it for decision making. In fact, before any action is taken, permission must be granted by the brain, including involuntary actions like the 'blinking' of the eye. The brain must decide whether it is the best course of action before the body can respond to it.

*It is smart*: It's able to measure the time difference between when an incidence is noticed and when it becomes fatal. *It knows time is a valuable asset*: It is able to predict the time available to your disposal to make a quick decision and that the more time you have, the better the decision will be. Well, may be you need not blink, waving your hand against the insect is probably the best course of action. *It is fast*: able to calculate the outcome of a lot actions and choose the best in the least amount of time.

And so, doing the math (for you or by you), it makes a decision.


# You may be wrong

Back to my question. When we teach color, we are quite explicit our them. We hold up a blue chalk and tell the kid, when you see this, call it blue. In other words, when your brain registers this color, it's name is blue. We present the colors as fact, not something to be debated about. 
Facts are very important. The color of a color is a fact, not something to be debated.
The difficulty isn't in accepting the fact, but knowing when you're wrong. Now if I had a slight color deficiency, I have learnt that things I see of this sort are called blue. Well, so blue. But probably it may not be the blue everybody sees.
So, although we can all agree on various facts, we mostly disagree on the conceptual level. Our difference in idealogy may be attributed to the physical formation of our brain or the influence of society or even our present state. But

# Selfishness of the brain

The fundamental responsibility of the human brain is ensuring survival. Survival of the self. You see, no matter how good, selfless and kind you think you're, which may be true, no doubt, we are all selfish at the core. This seems too much of a claim, so let me clarify.
The brain is a feedback loop system. This is one of those things that is not open for a debate. Whatever you do, the brain receives a feedback abd adjusts itself based on it. If it's a positive feedback, it will want to do more and if it is a negative feedback, it will want to do less. When you do that thing that you think is a good thing to be done, you will want to do it again only and only if you receive a positive feedback on it. This feedback system is more complicated than I have probably described, but it's there. Take for instance, drug addicts, they are fully aware of the effects of these drugs on their body, but their brains has prioritized the feeling of "getting high" than this awareness, so they keep taking it. So you see, although giving away that money to that poor girl may not have felt easy, you still did it, and then you felt good about yourself. Positive feedback. 

This is important. We should be aware that our perception about others, our judgement of them and our kind advices for others originate from a selfish brain, that makes it decisions based on the feedback it expects to receive.

# The Best it can do

Could the brain do better? Well not likely. Since, we do not have well defined set of rights and wrongs, the best it can do is learn from its mistakes. It puts together the facts available, makes some assumptions and keeps learning with experience. This learning is an on-going process, what it deemed right yesterday can be nullified tomorrow based on some new information it received today. So it is fundamental then that nobody knows everything, and at best we are all imperfect. Moreover, we are really just beating about the bush.

However, since we cannot live to make all mistakes and build our experience from them, we should make good use of the mistakes and advice of others. What went wrong for him or her, could also be wrong for you. And worst of all, some mistakes cannot be remedied, hence, it is best we learn them without experiencing them for ourselves. Even mistakes that can be remedied will definitely waste our time and energy. 

# Programing the brain

Do you see the problem. Has that beautiful brain of yours conceived the issue at hand? We know the brain is imperfect. Yet, this is the very thing that determines every action we take. A mad man is only mad because someone he's convinced in his madness he's right and everybody is probably wrong. And so if you were somehow convinced that killing people was the right thing to do, you will do it, despite the odds. It is difficult for the brain to find its own faults. Although all humans can agree on the fundamental nature of things like color, we tend to vary so much at the conceptual level. That's why countries have democracy, and even yet some people feel like democracy is the problem.

Do you know why things drop when you throw them in the air. Well, there are two gods, one for the skies and one for the earth. The god of earth is far stronger than the one of the skies. So when you throw something, they start struggling for posession but at the end, the god of the earth wins and the items falls to the ground.

Dumb right?. Yeah, it is. But my brain, well my brain thinks it's cute, so let's do with that for now.

Science is one of the frontiers of our human society that is bent on showing us the truth. Without science, anything can be conceived to be true.
Please forgive me here, really I must say this, but your religion could just be a deception. Your personal feelings and well experiences may be wrong. As a matter of fact, the fact that there is not a single religion shows that yours could be the wrong one. The fact that you don't think this is a possibility proves the point of this whole discussion.

You need to leave room for doubts. This is hard to bear of course. But been too certain about your idealogies and beliefs is never good to yourself and to anybody. For example, the existence of God, unless you can prove with facts (verified by others like the color blue), is still open for questioning. And this is true, no matter how it makes you feel. Death could be final, it could be not. We don't know. No matter what your religion has cooked up for you to swallow, nobody knows.

# How Deception can be a good thing

Well, if we do want to deceive ourselves with things that cannot be proven, we better do it well and probably stay consistent. There are things we cannot change despite how we feel about them. For example, the death of a loved one. The fact is his death is real, so what can go wrong if you convince yourslf he's "not really dead" and that he's in another place, a better place, waiting for you. Or probably not, may be he found another hubby.

There are times when deception proves useful. In fact, forget that I said it. It is difficult for one to deceieve him or herself with a lie when he has already been convinced of the facts. But when it is possible, it really doesn't hurt to play some tricks on the brain for your own good. May be you don't even have to play any tricks, because the brain itself has difficulties accepting facts that are may not produce a positive feedback. And so sometimes, the truth may stare at us in the face, yet we may choose to believe the lie. This can be acceptable to some extent, but you need to be aware of it.

Well, our brains cannot bear the fact that our life is meaningless, so it may be better for us to cook up all sorts of fancilful fantasies.
Let me tell you one, in Norse mythology, there is a place called Valhalla. It is a majestic, enormous hall located in Asgard, ruled over by the god Odin. Chosen by Odin, half of those who die in combat travel to Valhalla upon death, led by valkyries, while the other half go to the goddess Freyja's field Folkvang. In Valhalla, the dead join the masses of those who have died in combat known as Einherjar and various legendary Germanic heroes and kings, as they prepare to aid Odin during the events of Ragnarok. ere they drink and enjoy each others company telling of the heroic deeds that they have accomplished on earth.

Seriously this sounds more fun that what some religions cook up for their members to eat. No offence intended.

# Where did you get that idea?

[ Be Warned, I cook up things for you to eat here! ]

But why must there be a point to life? What is the problem of just living and dying. Without religion and the existence of a god, life is pointless. Well, may be that's the point. Relax, cool down just for a second. Why is it difficult for you to accept the fact that probably all you'll ever see is this life? Why do you want to give up that which you hold, in expectation of something which is uncertain? Well.

Well, the question is, if this life is all that it is, is it worth living?

You see, my problem is why must anything be worth anything. Why can't it just be pointless, valueless? Why do our minds want to associate meaning to everything. Perhaps, it's one of those things we are all deceived! One of those things our brains are mistaken.


# Escaping our own madness

A healthy brain should be willing to doubt itself. Only the insane are absolutely right and need no reflection of themselves.

Can we outsmart ourselves?
