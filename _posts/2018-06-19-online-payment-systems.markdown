The last two decades has seen a great stride in information technology. This vast development has changed the way business problems are conceived and solved. Whiles technology has made some problems easier to solve, it has also introduced problems of its own. However, due to the competitive nature of the business world, most businesses are either forced to prematurely adopt these new trends or left to mature the old ways of doing things.

Nonetheless, change is difficult. Factors such as the cost, the learning curve, user acceptance, integration and backward compatibility into existing systems cause most businesses to demur from such advancements even when the benefits are obvious. The banking sector of India's economy is no exception.


## Background Information

This article provides a detailed explanation of the various options available for making online payments, how to avail each service, benefits of using the service, issues related to that service and finally, precautions to take whiles using each service. 

You are free to skip sections for payment systems that you have no interest in of course. However, I advice taking sometime to understand all the options available, so that you will be able to make the best decision next time you have to make an online payment.

## Who makes the rules?

*The Reserve Bank of India*.

The preamble of the Reserve Bank of India describes the basic functions of the reserve bank as:

>"to regulate the issue of Bank notes and keeping of reserves with a view to securing monetary stability in India and generally to operate the currency and credit system of the country to its advantage; to have a modern monetary policy framework to meet the challenge of an increasingly complex economy, to maintain price stability while keeping in mind the objective of growth."


A central bank is a vital institution of any country's economy that performs activities and functions with the goal of maintaining economic stability and growth of an economy. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is India's **central banking** institution with the responsibility of supervising the financial sector of the country comprising of commercial banks, financial institutions and non-banking companies, managing foreign exchanges, issuing of currency and enacting new rules and regulations that governs the use of its systems. 

## Payment Systems

Most online merchants provide you a set of payment options from which you can make purchases. Here is an example of the payment options provided by <a href="https://www.makemytrip.com" target="blank">MakeMyTrip</a>.<br><br>

## Bank Transfer / Net Banking

Bank Transfer enables electronic transfer of funds from the account of the remitter in one bank to the account of a beneficiary maintained with any other branch. There are two systems for inter-bank transfers - RGTS and NEFT. Both of these systems are maintained by the Reserve Bank of India.

### Real Time Gross Settlement (RGTS) / National Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT)

The major difference between RTGS and NEFT system is that, with RTGS, the processing of funds is real time (instantaneous). This also means that once the payment is processed, they are final and irrevocable. Moreover, each transaction or request is independent (gross settlement) and are settled on its own without bundling or netting with other transactions. This is the fastest possible interbank money transfer available through secure banking channels in India.

On the other hand, with NEFT, the settlements of fund transfer operates on a Deferred Net Settlement basis. This means that they are settled in batches. Presently, NEFT operates in half hourly batches on bank working days only and will reflect in beneficiary account in a maximum of 2-3 hours. 

### How to avail RGTS/NEFT

1. You must first enable Internet Banking facility for your account with transaction rights. By default, Internet Banking is disabled. You can contact your         base branch to get it activated.
2. After activation, you will get a username and a password with which you can login to your banks 'internet banking portal'.
3. Some banks will only allow you to send funds to beneficiaries. Beneficiaries once created, take up 4 hours to get activated. Use your banks portal to add a beneficiary account. Details you will need include: 
    - Beneficiary Name
    - Beneficiary Account Number
    - Address
    - IFSC code
    - Transfer Limit (only supported by some banks)
4. After the beneficiary account is created and activated, you can use the Transfer Funds option on your banks portal to make transfers to beneficiaries.
5. If you have multiple accounts with the same bank, make sure the right account is being debited. Bank portals usually select a default account for you and give you the option to change it.


### Issues with RGTS/NEFT

1. RGTS/NEFT does not work on some saturdays and all sundays
2. They do not work on non-banking hours, that is before 08:00 AM and after 07:00 pm
3. They do not work on bank holidays
4. Transfer delay which is more explicit with NEFT
5. Details of remitter is not clear in the transaction. Only the remitters name and amount is shared with the beneficiary. Details like PAN Number and Aadhar       Number is not shared, which can make it difficult to track down issues related to transactions.
6. Most banks charge you for intra-bank (accounts of other banks) transfers. 
7. Overhead of adding beneficiary accounts before initiating a transaction
8. Some banks website portals are unreliable and have poor user experience.
9. Not all banks fully support these services. A list of such RGTS/NEFT enabled banks across the country can be obtained from RBI website: <a href="https://www.onlinesbi.com/personal/neft_rtgs_faq.html" target="blank">RGTS Enabled banks</a> and <a href="http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/neft.aspx" target="blank">NEFT Enabled banks</a>


Due to the drawbacks associated with RGTS/NEFT, RBI has provided a third option: IMPS.

### Immediate Payment Service (IMPS)

IMPS is known to be the most popular and fastest methods of funds transfer. It is used widely across most banks and usually the preferred method of payment. Unlink the other modes of payment that can become unavailable on bank holidays and during non-working hours, IMPS functions 24/7 allowing funds transfer at any time of the day, including Sundays. IMPS is also real time and works best by combining the various advantages of RGTS and NEFT. Many of the digital wallets (to be discussed below) use IMPS service to credit and discount money from users wallet to bank accounts. Moreover, the cost of IMPS is same as that of NEFT. <br><br>

| Transaction Timings       | NEFT           | RTGS  | IMPS  |
| ----------------------- |:-------------:| -----:| -----:|
| Monday to Saturday (Except 2nd and 4th Saturday)                | 8:00 AM to 6:30 PM | 8:00 AM to 4:30 PM | 24x7

| Transaction Limits       | NEFT           | RTGS  | IMPS  |
| ----------------------- |:-------------:| -----:| -----:|
| Minimum                | Rs 1 | Rs 2 lakhs | Rs 1
| Maximum                | Rs 10 lakhs | Rs 10 lakhs | Rs 2 lakhs

## Cards Payment

A Bank Card is a plastic payment card that can be used for payments instead of cash when making purchases. Some cards can actually carry a stored value with which you can make purchases, but most cards in India withdraw funds from the cardholders bank account.<br><br>

![Plastic Card](/assets/img/payments/card.png)
<br><br><br>
The card contains a unique card number and some security information such as the expiry date of the card, CVVC (CVV, usually found at the back), or a magnetic strip that enables various machines to read and access information from the card. These cards are very versatile in the sense that they can be used in a lot of circumstances. A cardholder can easily withdraw some cash with it at a nearby ATM machine or for payments to a merchant.

There are two main types of card payment systems: Credit and Debit cards. There are other specialized cards including, ATM, Stored-Value and Fleet cards.

### Credit Card Payments

A credit card is linked to a line of credit (credit limit) that allows the cardholder to draw (borrow) either for payments to a merchant or as a cash advance to the cardholder. You can then choose to repay the full balance by due date which will incur no charges or pay only a percentage of what you owe, which will incur charges.

### Debit Card Payments

With a debit card, when a cardholder makes a purchase, funds are withdrawn directly from the cardholders bank account or from the remaining balance of the card instead of hoping to pay at a later date.
The use of debit cards is the most popular form of card payment in India. This has removed various bottlenecks associated with cash and cheque payments. Debit cards also allow instant withdrawal of cash at any nearest ATM machine.  

### How to avail a Debit Card

Getting a debit card is typically as easy as opening a bank account. 

1. Visit your base branch and request for a new debit card.
2. Fill the form provided.
3. You will receive it in the next 4-7 working days at your address.
4. After you receive it, you may have to follow some procedures to generate an ATM PIN. This pin number (4 digit pin) will allow you to withdraw money from ATM machines.


### Issues with Debit Cards

1. Debit cards can be stolen. It is advised to change your ATM PIN every once in a while.
2. Cardholder can forget ATM PIN, which can be recovered.
3. ATM withdrawal charges when used more than a certain number of times in a month
4. Difficult to keep track of expenditure since, you are allowed to make unlimited transactions.


### Benefits with Debit Cards

1. Easy to obtain. Just apply for it from your bank and receive it at your doorstep.
2. Versatile and convenient. Can be used for online purchases, physical retail payments and withdrawing cash for immediate use.
3. Banks usually have quick methods of blocking card if you loose it or suspect fraudulent activities.
4. Deposit money into your account with Cash Deposit Machines without the need to visit a branch.
5. Portable and reliable. Can be carried in a pocket wallet anyway.
6. Safety, by not having to carry so much cash with you. You can always get money anytime.
7. Readily accepted. Most retail shops have facilities for making card payments.

### Safety Precautions for using Debit cards

1. NEVER share your ATM PIN or CVVC (CVV) number with anyone, even when the person is from your bank. Nobody. Do report anyone who attempts to get your information.
2. Memorize your PIN. Do not write it down anywhere, and certainly never on the card itself.
3. Do not take help from strangers for using the ATM card or handling your cash.
4. Guard it against loss or theft. Personally, I keep mine in my pocket wallet. Women usually make use of their purses.
5. If you loose your card, notify your bank immediately. They will block it on your behalf and make sure no one can use it afterwards.
6. Keep receipts (or at least the digital ones), this will help you to keep track of expenses.
7. Most banks will email or send you an SMS for any transaction in your account.
8. Review your statements periodically.


## Digital/Mobile Wallets

Digital Wallets are one the greatest innovation in the field of technology. Millions of people can make purchases, transfer of funds from these virtual wallets. Moreover, with the rise of the number of digital wallets in India, the competition has risen which has in return improved the services that these companies provide.

This rapid digitalization of India's monetary system is slated to grow by 500 billion by 2020. Although recent strict regulations by RBI has come as a blow to most digital wallets.

### Issues with Digital Wallets

1. Your digital wallet is separate from your bank account. You will need to load money manually into your digital wallet.
2. Some payment platforms support only a few digital wallets and so your digital wallet is not supported. 
3. Risk of security fraud if you mishandle your smartphone, including risk of identity theft.
4. Issues with compatibility. There are too many digital wallets with nearly no compatibility among them. You may need to sign up for multiple digital wallets to be able to use major services available online.
5. Due to recent RBI rules, you can't send money to a bank account (even your own) from a digital wallet. This means that, once you upload money to a digital       wallet, you can withdraw it to an account. You have to use it for some purchase. Because of this, most wallets also place a limit on how much money you can     deposit into your wallet.
6. Few merchant acceptance.
7. Poor internet connection which can often cause issues using these services.
8. Lack of technical know-how.
9. Transaction limit of 20,000 INR as per RBI rules.
10. KYC Verification using Aadhar card and PAN card.
11. Inadequate laws by RBI. Its difficult to trust these services as RBI is constantly reviewing its regulations.

### Benefits of Digital Wallets

1. Convenience and ease of use. Digital wallets can be accessed easily using major smartphones.
2. No charges for most transactions.
3. Chance of enjoying offers and promotions offered by the companies. For example, you can earn a free movie ticket for using airtel money.

5. Minimization of loss. If your account is hacked, the damage can easily be controlled.
6. Always available and reliable.
7. Easy tracking of expenditure. History of expenditure is available on the app
8. Some digital wallets can be used offline.

Due to the issue of interoperability among digital wallets. the National Payments Corporation has developed a unified payment paltform that is regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) called Uniform Payments Interface (UPI).


##  Uniform Payments Interface (UPI)

Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is an instant real-time payment system developed by National Payments Corporation of India facilitating inter-bank transactions. The interface is regulated by the Reserve Bank of India and works by instantly transferring funds between two bank accounts on a mobile platform.

UPI is built over Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) for transferring funds, and therefore is real time. Being a digital payment system, it is available 24-7 and across public holidays. Unlike traditional mobile or digital wallets, which takes a specified amount of money from user and stores it in its own accounts, UPI withdraws and deposits funds directly from the bank account whenever a transaction is requested.

It uses Virtual Payment Address (a unique ID provided by the bank) usually in the form of an email address (eg. abcdef@axis). You can make payments to someone just by specifying their Unique Identification (UID). You are not only limited to this, you can also send funds using an Account Number with IFS Code, Mobile Number with MMID (Mobile Money Identifier), Aadhaar Number, or a one-time use Virtual ID.

A UPI-PIN (UPI Personal Identification number that one creates on the UPI app of the bank) is required to confirm each payment.

This is the easiest and smartest form of payment available as at now. Tez an app developed by Google and the BHIM app developed by the National Payments Corporation of India. These apps build on this payment system. Moreover, most banks have UPI payment option included in their mobile apps. This is a real step for India towards becoming a cashless economy.

### How to avail UPI

1. First make sure you have enabled internet banking for your bank account.
2. Make sure you have the mobile number linked with your bank account.
3. Download an UPI enabled app (Tez or BHIM) will do.
4. Register by validating your phone number and account information.
5. Create a virtual ID, something that people can reach you by. eg. barkhasingh@hdfc. 
6. Setup an MPIN, if you haven't created one already. You will be asked for this ID anytime you want to make a transaction.
7. Done.

### Benefits of UPI

1. Absolutely 0 transaction charges in all banks
2. Transaction limit of one lakh
3. Interoperable
4. More than 30 banks (major banks) are already providing this service
5. Enjoy all benefits of other payment systems.


## Others Payment Options

There are other payment options available. These are mostly useful for international payments.

These include: 
 - Western Union 
 - PayPal

 - 2Checkout


## Future of Online Payment Systems

Although India is still a developing country, it's technological advancements over the past two decades are astonishing. We are still hoping for a better future as these current payment options take their time to mature.

1. First we expect a stabilization of RBI rules concerning how digital wallets should operate.
2. Blockchain or Cryptocurrency technology in digital payments in India - eg. Bitcoin.
3. Expansion and improvement of current payment systems
4. Increasing importance of security
5. Replacing old infrastructures with new ones. eg. NEFT, that is not real time.
