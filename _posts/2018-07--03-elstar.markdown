Although the whole science of "dreaming" is not yet fully known. We can all agree on some level that dreams occur when our darling minds concur images for us during our sweet sleep. Most of the time, I think our limitations as human beings are based on the foundations that we are building upon. Our minds have rather grown accustomed these limitations to the point that we can't we can't think of anything else. We fail to see the problems around us and even worse, the solutions.

Most of the devices around us are built to require a constant supply of electricity. My question is, what if instead of working and researching on producing cheaper sources of electricity, we can rather work our way towards a fuel-less planet. But is this even possible? Matter can neither be created nor destroyed but can only be converted from one form to another. Our own bodies require food (probably three to four times a day) as fuel to function. These devices burn energy but since they are not lesser-gods, they cannot create one for themselves. We must provide energy to these devices in one form or the other, and be able to convert the energy into a form they can utilize. I guess that's the way things are. We can never have a fuel-less planet as long as the devices are burning energy.

Some sources of energy are cheaper than others. So we rather work to replace those that are more expensive (usually hard to come by) with ones that are cheaper. So, let's talk about making electricity cheaper and available.

Technology and and as a result development in Africa is lacking due to the unavailability and unreliability of electricity. Modern civilization builds upon electricity, digitalization is built on the assumption that there is a reliable source of electricity. Many research has been conducted with the aim of making electricity available to all.

## Little Electrical Stars

Recently, I embarked on a little toy project that involved finding a way to extinguish the sun. No, really, what fuels the sun? Since, no one is constantly refilling the sun's source of energy, is it ever going to run out? We know for certain  however that, the sun is not burning out very soon, at least not for the next 5 billion years.

What were we talking about again? Yeah, making electricity available for all.

So we can have these small electricity-producing things in Space, which I call Elstars. An Elstar can conduct and transmit the suns energy into a form that can be used as electricity.

## The Physics of an Elstar

Let me help you understand how an elstar works
<br><br><br>

The function of the base is basically to conduct the sun's heat energy. Because this is the first point of conduct, it will probably be made of one of those metals that rockets are usually made of. The point is, it should be hard enough not to melt and should be able to last a very long time. I would not want to climb there every night to change it, so it better be.

This heat energy is then conducted by the right conducting rod, called producer. Immediately, this heat energy is conducted by the left conducting rod, called consumer. Nothing happens after that.

However, next time that the producer is charged by the sun's energy, because the consumer is also already charged, a tension is built in that space between the consumer and the producer. This tension build and reaction causes an electrical charge to be discharged which is immediately conducted by the Savior. 

It's called Savior because, well, it just saved an electrical charge from going to waste. Thank you. 

This electrical charge is then transferred to transmitter that can transmit an electrical energy from Space to an electrical tower on earth. All we have to do then is provide more towers like what mobile network providers have being doing until the whole planet is electrified.

I won't be surprised at all if aliens on another planet are already implementing this idea. Most of my brilliant ideas are usually implemented by others except this one, so I can be sure of this.
