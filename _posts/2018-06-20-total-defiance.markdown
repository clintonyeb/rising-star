Like a house slave sweeping dirt into a pile, The Creator had heaped together all my horrors and sins. Whistling a nursery song, he gathered barbarities and cruelties and outrages as I lay on my back in the center of it all, arms spread, legs spread, thrashing against my bonds. Dustpan filled to overflowing with creosote sins and The Creator turned toward me for the first time.

As he turned, his face was blinding bright, unknowable, a miasma of razor-edged light, but at the corner of his mouth, his beard twitched with a torturer’s glee.

“Servient omnes,” The Creator said. All shall serve. And as He spoke, I felt my ears prick, my blood warm, my heart pump, and my will bent in acquiescence to his voice.

He upended his dustpan over my face. I tried to scream defiance, to defy him to his face, but my words were taken from me like silk torn from the spool in a spider’s gut, unwinding until it snapped inside of me, leaving me empty and shattered inside. I tried to turn away from him, twist, look away, but my eyes were propped open. There was no escaping the bulbous, congealed ordure schloomping toward his eye.

The whole mass of the hall fell. And as it fell, it caught fire and burnt in the air, sizzling, spattering, spitting angrily. But then he was no more. I could feel it, he had left me alone to perish.

And afire, all the world’s sin fell into my eye and set my orb aflame. The fire sank sizzling into my socket, gases escaping, tssst, like a sigh from a disappointed father at his failure son. I tried to scream, I tried to bend away, but it was as if my will was in bondage.

And one fire ball lodged into my right eye, burning, tried to scream again but got nothing, my anger stirred, my hatred boiled and my bones quivered.

This continued for ages past counting, until my throat was raw and tongue was dry, until deserts blew barren sands into snow, and my attempts to shriek faded, and my skin grew hard and cracked, and the burning shard impaled me, pinning me to the world and my sins, cooled by temperature’s reckoning but not by pain’s, and the shard crystallized, and the smoke cleared, and gasping, I woke from my dream by a sharp pain from the left cheek.

The soldier on the left, Rufus said, does this man refuse to die? The other soldier responded, this thing, has for seventeen years stood against everything good. Killed families, children, burnt cities and slaughtered kings in their beds. Most men thought of him as a myth, a ghost, the devil.

Three times he has nearly being captured but has managed to escape. But there he is, a mere man, hanging with his arms and legs nailed to a cross for the past six days. The council having deliberated about what to do with him finally decided killing him will be an act of mercy, but that he should be left alone to die at the mercy of The Creator. 

And for six days?, Rufus asked. 

Yes, for siz days, he has hang there, showing no trace of remorse and refusing to die.

But now he wakes gasping for air and sweating profusely, Rufus added, as if cutting the man before he could competed his sentence. Perhaps even The Creator has abandoned him. What happens to a man should the living and the dead despise him? Rufus asked.

Even so, before the two young soldiers could finish their discourse, the man on the tree had died, Gull was dead.

57 AD.
